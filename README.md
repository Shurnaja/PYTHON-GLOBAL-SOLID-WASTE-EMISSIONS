# Solid waste emissions 2015-2021

## Project overview: 
Solid waste emissions enormously contribute to the polution of the environment. Every year, an estimated 11.2 billion tonnes of solid waste is collected worldwide, which contributes to about 5 % of the global greenhouse gas emissions (www.unep.org). 
According to Statista, by 2050, worldwide municipal solid waste generation is expected to have increased by roughly 70 percent to 3.4 billion metric tons (www.statista.com).  

The project illustrates the global geographical distribution of total gas emissions generated by solid waste (paper, plastic, glass, metal) between 2015 and 2021, hence highlighting the leading countries regarding the quantity of gas emissions. The project also analyses relationships between gas emissions and population, as well as between GDP per capita and Waste Managament Index* respectively.

* The Waste Management issue category recognizes the threats of solid waste to human and environmental health. It is based on three indicators: controlled solid waste, recycling rates, and ocean plastic pollution.

## Objectives of the data analysis: 
- To conduct an EDA and describe patterns in the data, such as the average rental rate, revenue, number of active customers, etc.
- To establish which top 10 countries and cities had the highest number of customers in 2006.
- To determine the top 10 countries with the highest revenue and the 5 most loyal customers in 2006.
